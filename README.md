My Personal Diary App

This is a lightweight full-stack diary application. It has a React-based frontend and an Express.js backend. You can run it locally or using Docker for a consistent setup.

Features

Add, view, and delete diary entries.

Clean and user-friendly interface.

Stores data in a simple JSON file for easy testing and demonstration.

Running Locally

For local development, start the backend first and then the frontend. The backend serves the API, while the frontend provides the user interface in your browser.

Using Docker

You can also run the app using Docker and docker-compose for a consistent environment. This allows both frontend and backend to run together without manual setup.

Notes

All diary entries are saved in a JSON file.

Designed for quick testing and personal use.
