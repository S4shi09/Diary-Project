# My Personal Diary App

A lightweight full-stack diary application with a React frontend and Express.js backend. The app allows you to maintain personal diary entries in a clean, user-friendly interface. You can run it locally or with Docker for a consistent setup.

## Features
- Add, view, and delete diary entries.
- Minimalist and intuitive design for easy use.
- Stores entries in a simple JSON file for easy local testing and demonstration.

## Running Locally
Start the backend first to serve the API, then launch the frontend to interact with the app in your browser.

## Using Docker
Optionally, you can use Docker and docker-compose to run both the frontend and backend together in a consistent environment.

## Notes
- Diary entries are stored in a JSON file.
- Built for quick testing, demonstration, and personal use.
